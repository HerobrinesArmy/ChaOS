RETURN (If a BASIC prog is called by an ASM one, return stores the locations of BASIC variables in an area the ASMprog can read and hands control back to the task scheduler).

The CTRL-D combo enters debug mode, displaying an overlay of the programs data and variables, as well as any errors.

The CTRL-K combo kills the program no matter what, UNLESS the program is being called by an ASM prog as a subroutine.
