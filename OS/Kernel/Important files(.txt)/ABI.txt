CHA_OS Application Binary Interface
This interface requires three RAM entries per program
Each program is assigned an 6-bit variable from witch it can be called
1st, 2nd RAM entries are created partially by developer, partially by OS during install
install wizard takes program from first sector of floopy, asks if you want to continue, then installs, giving it a UPAPN and 2nd RAM entry
3rd RAM entry is created by developer
