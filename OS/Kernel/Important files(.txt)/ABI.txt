CHA_OS Application Binary Interface
This interface requires seven RAM entries per program
1st, 2nd RAM entries are created partially by developer, partially by OS during install
Install Wizard takes program from first sector of floppy, asks if you want to continue, then installs, giving it a 2nd RAM entry
3-10 RAM entries are created by developer
For easy creation of Second RAM entry (for Win Vista/7 Users)
 open calculator
 go to 'programmer'
 click 'bin', and 'word'
 fill in the binary (don't worry about the screen)
 click 'hex'
