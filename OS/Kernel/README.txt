The Kernel currently HWQ's all devices we know of per Notch's information on the DCPU-16, and lauches TEMPOS from a floppy.
TempOS is the code gererated by SomeOS (because different files have a different purpose in file projects than in disk projects).
A basic memory manager is included, but needs extension.
