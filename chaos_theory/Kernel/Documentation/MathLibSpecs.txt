MathLib 1.1.0 Specifications:

setDefaultBase
	-READS: A

	Sets the default base of all equations to the A register, provided that A is between 2-16

newEquation
	-READS: A
	-WRITES: A

	Reads a string of numbers and operations and evaluates the answer.
	
	Numbers can have "base tags" at the end of it which will change the base of that specific number.
	The bases are i for binary, o for octal, t for ten, h for hexadecimal.
		- ex. 100i evaluates to 6 while 100o evaluates to 64

	Current Operators:
	+ 	addition
	- 	subtraction
	* 	multiplication
	/	division (integer)
	!	fibonacci
	`	square root (always rounds down)
	:	factorial
	%	modulo
	^	exponent

	Note that this program follows the order of operation except factorial (:), fibonacci (!), and square root (`), which have the highest priority.
	In addition the 3 previously stated operations must be place behind the number.
		-ex. `16 is correct syntax while 16` will return an error

	Comparison Operators:
	=	Equal To
	>	Greater Than
	<	Less Than

	If at least one comparison operator is included, the equation will return 1 if true and 0 if false
	If there are no comparison operators, the value of the numbers will be returned.

	Note that multiple comparison operators can be used.
		-ex. 5=5=5 will parse to 5=(5=5), then 5=1, then 0.

	Please note that any error in the equation will automatically return the value 0

distance3DSpace
	-READS: A,B,C,X,Y,Z
	-WRITES: I

	Returns the distance in 3 Dimensional space from point (a,b,c) to point (x,y,z)
