	MULTI-TASKING SYSTEM SPECS

The Goal of the Multi-tasking system is as follows:

Allow a preempive solution to multiple programs

Enable process switching where progs have no idea of other progs

Make the Implemtation completely independant of programs, for easy modification


IMPLEMENTATION:

A Clock handler will be used to switch between programs,
using a priority-based round robin system.

Each program will have a time quantum based off of their priority and CPU time available

Every time the clock interrupt triggers, it will switch programs, based on their priority

For example, the ChaOS CLI will have a priority of +100 (on a scale of +32767 to -32767)

Programs will have a stack size of 100 words, which should be enough for them, branching downward from the main stack

Each slot will contain the following information:

Location of PC in that program

Priority level

Registers (A,B,I,X,Y,J,Z, and SP)

The algorithm to determine what program goes next is as follows (courtesy of macman)

Add all priorities

divide the priority for a program by the added amount

multiply by 100

That will be the CPU slice for that program, This will also equal the number of Kilo Hertz
Each program will execute for.

After selecting a program (the one with the highest CPU slice), the clock is modified in order
to only go off when the program needs to switch.

The switcher will keep track of how many kiloHertz have been used so far, and will only select programs
that will fit inside the timeframe, so this method should run all programs given to it.
